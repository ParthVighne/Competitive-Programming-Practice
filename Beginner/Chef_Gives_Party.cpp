! Chef gives Party

Chef wants to give a burger party to all his N friends i.e. he wants to buy one burger for each of his friends.

The cost of each burger is X rupees while Chef has a total of K rupees.

Determine whether he has enough money to buy a burger for each of his friends or not.

! Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains the three integers N, X, and K - the number of Chef's friends, the cost of each burger, and the total money Chef has, respectively.

For each test case, output YES if the Chef can give a party to all his N friends. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

! Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N,X≤100
1≤K≤10000

! Explanation
Test case 1: Chef has 5 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10×5=50 while Chef has 70 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 2: Chef has 5 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10×5=50 while Chef has 40 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 3: Chef has 10 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 40×10=400 and Chef has 400 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 4: Chef has 14 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 14×14=196 while Chef has 150 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
